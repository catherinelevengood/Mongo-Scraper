### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

## Instructions

* This app accomplishes the following:

  1. Whenever a user visits site, the app scrapes stories from DEVELOPER-TECH.COM and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is also saved to the application's database. The app scrapes and display the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

     * Article Image Thumbnail

  2. Users are also able to leave notes on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and they are associated with their articles. Users are also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
